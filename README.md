# Real-Time-Bus-Tracking
1) In this project, we make a map using mapboxgl javascript library and point to the stops from MIT to Harvard using Javascript, Html and CSS

   <body>Clone this repository on to the local system and then run it through VS Code on a window on the local host. Then click on Show stops between MIT and Harvard button to test the project.</body>

3) <h>Future Improvements :</h>

    <body>Right now, the code creates a button on a map. When I click on the button, a marker goes through the stops from MIT and Harvard. I can try the same between             different places with different styles on the map </body>
